I've also contributed to the following projects; CSV parsers, bank ATM features, simple grade checkers, an interactive game called <a target="_blank" class="anchor-text" href="https://github.com/nilejack/24q4-team2/tree/main"><em><b>numMeCrazy</b></em></a> and much more. In addition to learning how to learn in an efficient manner, I was able to obtain another valuable skill; namely, how to optimize my learning process in group settings through collaborative learning. With a collective approach to abstracting complex concepts I was able to not only help myself, but my team members as well. Working in a collaborative environment also enhanced my soft skills.</p>

                            </a>
                            <p> I stumbled into the audio sector because the opportunity presented itself, and I picked up the trade pretty quickly. I began my audio journey as a studio intern at Manhattan Beach Recordings. After a six-month tenure there, I began to work independently, mainly in live sound at several local bars in the Brooklyn area. In addition to live sound work, I ran a plethora of vocal tracking, mixing, and song-writing sessions for various artists; most notably, Wale, DreamDoll, Playboi Carti, Jada Kingdom, and Skepta. As an audio engineer, I had to work in rapidly changing environments all the time, which allowed me to better hone my adaptive skillset. Working with electrical circuitry was a significant part of my work; from repairing tweeters, replacing transducers in microphones, replacing circuit boards on mixing consoles, soldering damaged wires and much more. Here is a list of studios I've worked in: Manhattan Beach Recordings, Quad Studios, Power Station at BerkleeNYC, Platinum Sound Recordings, and Jungle City Studios.</p>

Working as a jeweler in a factory was extremely challenging; due to the fast working pace and high-quality standard, but it's where I discovered my love for problem-solving.</p>

                                <p>Project Summary: I developed a comprehensive library management REST API using Spring Boot that implements core library operations through a clean layered architecture. The project features a well-structured domain model with separate entity and domain objects, maintaining proper separation of concerns. I implemented book management functionality including creation, retrieval, and availability checking, along with user management and book checkout capabilities. The application utilizes Spring Data JPA for database operations with an H2 in-memory database for development. I incorporated robust error handling and implemented comprehensive unit tests using JUnit and Mockito to ensure code reliability. The API follows RESTful principles with appropriate HTTP status codes and response entities, demonstrating my ability to design maintainable, well-tested backend services.As an ongoing project, I plan to expand the system with additional features including user management, checkout history tracking, and potentially a recommendation system based on borrowing patterns. <a target="_blank" class="anchor-text" href="https://github.com/Nautevol07VII-111/Books-REST-API"><em><b>REST API</b></em></a></p>

                                <p>Project Summary: I developed a responsive Google Search clone that faithfully recreates the iconic search interface while implementing modern web development practices and real search functionality. The project demonstrates my proficiency with contemporary front-end technologies and third-party API integration.
                                    The application was built using Vite as the development environment, showcasing my understanding of modern build tools. Vite's hot module replacement (HMR) capabilities enabled rapid development cycles, while its optimized build process ensures efficient production deployment. The project structure leverages Vite's conventions for asset handling and environment variable management, particularly for securing API credentials.
                                    For package management, I utilized Node Package Manager (npm) to handle project dependencies and streamline the development workflow. The package.json configuration includes custom scripts for development, building, and deployment processes. Notable dependencies include gh-pages for automated GitHub Pages deployment, demonstrating my ability to implement continuous deployment practices.
                                    The search functionality integrates Google's Custom Search API, allowing real-world search capabilities while maintaining the familiar Google interface. The implementation includes debounced search handling to optimize API calls, error handling for failed requests, and support for both standard search and "I'm Feeling Lucky" functionality. The search component demonstrates thoughtful user experience considerations, including loading states and error feedback.
                                    The user interface precisely mimics Google's design language while adding subtle customizations. I implemented responsive design principles using pure CSS, ensuring the application works seamlessly across different device sizes. The project features carefully crafted hover states, transitions, and animations that enhance the user experience while maintaining performance.
                                    To ensure maintainable code, I organized the project into modular components with clear separation of concerns. The JavaScript implementation follows modern ES6+ practices, including proper event handling, async/await patterns for API calls, and defensive programming techniques. The styling utilizes CSS best practices with a well-structured hierarchy and reusable components.
                                    This project demonstrates my ability to create professional-grade web applications that combine aesthetic design, technical functionality, and production-ready deployment processes. The GitHub Pages deployment pipeline showcases my understanding of modern web application deployment workflows.

        <p>Project Summary: I developed a dynamic task management application using React and Vite, showcasing modern web development practices and state management principles. The project demonstrates my proficiency with React's useState hook for handling dynamic user interactions and data persistence. I implemented features for adding, completing, and deleting tasks, with all changes persisting through browser sessions via localStorage integration. The application architecture emphasizes clean component structure and efficient state updates, while the development process provided valuable experience with contemporary tools like Vite for rapid development and optimization. Through challenges with environment configurations and module dependencies, I gained practical insights into debugging, dependency management, and deployment workflows. This project particularly highlights my growing expertise with React's ecosystem and modern JavaScript development patterns. <a target="_blank" class="anchor-text" href="https://dailytodoprototype.netlify.app"><em><b>Live Demo</b></em></a></p>
